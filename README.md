# Django Application

This Django application allows registered users to build their own custom sports league consisting of Conferences, Teams and Players. Each Conference has a set of teams, and each team has a set of players. Users must first register and create an account before creating their league. Conferences must be created before Teams and Teams must be created before Players as this application works from the top level down. All three models can have objects created, edited and deleted.
